This project will deal with employee attrition data in business domain. Hiring and retaining top talent is an extremely challenging task for the HR department, which requires skill, capital, and time. Business owners spend up to 40% of their time on simple tasks not resulting in direct profit, such as hiring. For a new hire, 15-20% of their salary is spent on just recruitment. For better performance of the companies, the HR department has to take measures to reduce employee attrition.

I attempt to understand the likelihood of an employee leaving the company and identifying the key indicators for the attrition. With this analysis the company can adopt strategies to improve on employee retention. This is a supervised classification problem where the target is a binary variable, 0 and 1 for active employee and ex-employee.  In this study, our target variable is the probability of an employee leaving the company.
