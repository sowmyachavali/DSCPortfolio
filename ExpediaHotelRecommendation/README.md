Expedia has provided logs of customer behavior. These include what customers searched for, how they interacted with search results (click/book), whether or not the
search result was a travel package. The data in this project is a random selection from Expedia and is not representative of the overall statistics.

I am interested in predicting which hotel group a user is going to book. Our goal  is to predict the booking outcome (hotel cluster) for a user event, 
based on their search and other attributes associated with that user event.
