Life expectancy is based on an estimate of the average age that members of a particular population group will be when they die. It’s no secret, though, that life expectancy varies widely across the globe. I’ve always attributed living longer with increased access to healthcare and socio economic status of the country. To test this assumption and understand what actually best predicts life expectancy, I explored country-level data across the globe. 
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model which helps improve life expectancy by working on how each factor influence longevity across the countries in the world. This helps the countries work on improving these features for better life span. This is a cross-country study collecting different features from all the countries for the years between 2018 and 2019.

In conclusion the analysis aimed at choosing the relevant factors that affects the life expectancy. Japan has the highest life expectancy (84.3 years), Lesotho (52 years) and many countries in the African continent are at the bottom of scale. Taking good care of the environment and investing in health care has the larger impact on the country’s life expectancy.
