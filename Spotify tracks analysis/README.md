#### Spotify data analysis

Music is universal. It’s more than a billion-dollar industry, and it is omnipresent. How many hours in a row do you ever go without listening to music? I believe that music is a way of life. Listening to it makes my mind and soul feel great. I consider it a source of motivation, and as an ancient sage said: "Life without music would be a mistake".

Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video streaming service that gives us access to millions of songs and other content from artists all over the world. The purpose of this Spotify analysis project is to analyze how different or how similar is the music that different artists on the app produce. We will get to know which tracks/artists are the best, taking into consideration the numerical features like popularity, danceability, loudness, number of views, follower info etc. To achieve this, I would be sourcing 3 Spotify datasets from 3 different sources, a flat file, Spotify API and HTML data. Let’s explore each dataset.
