##### Video Game Sales
Since the early 1980s, video games have served as an increasingly popular source of entertainment and a fixture in modern pop culture, evolving from humble beginnings to a multibillion-dollar industry today. Throughout its history, the video game market has evolved significantly, reflecting the continuous improvements to the underlying graphics and game designs as computer technology has become more powerful.  With each successive year, more advanced consoles have spawned a plethora of video game titles and genres, with thousands of titles available and new developers cropping up to try and take a share of the market. Although I have played many video games for years, I have never thought about which platforms, publishers, and genres are responsible for the bulk of the sales and quality of the games we all love to play. So here in this analysis, I would like to take a deep dive into the three categories mentioned above along with the regional sales. I'll focus on these questions to better direct the focus, and shape of the analysis.

##### Research questions –
1.	What are the sales of video games per genre?
2.	What are sales of video games per platform?
3.	Visualizations of platforms’ total sales and understanding each platform’s composition.
4.	What are the top 5 publishers with highest global sales?
5.	What is the growth of the top publisher of games over years?
6.	Generate correlation table and observe the interaction between variables.
7.	Observation on Year Wise Video Game Releases
8.	Understanding the global sales pattern
9.	How are the changes in sales over time?

##### Dataset overview -
I analyzed data scraped from VGChartz.com, consisting of over 16,500 video game titles based either on consoles or computers and ranging from 1980-2016. The data spanned across 31 platforms, 12 genres, and over 500 publishers.



##### Summary of my findings -
When it comes to the platform market, Nintendo is a powerhouse. What surprises me the most, it's not only the quantity of games they are releasing year to year that are driving the results. Nintendo shows up more in 
the top 5 sales, top 10 sales, and top 100 sales than any other platform by a long shot. The only competitor being Microsoft, due to how big of a hit the xbox 360 was.
It seems to be a recurring theme in this analysis. Nintendo has proven year after year, the quality of their games are top notch. However, you have to give credit where credit is due. Activision shows the ability to make quality games. With Call of Duty releasing every year, and a younger generation that doesn’t care as much about story lines, and single player game modes, the online realm seems to be dominated by activision and EA.
The global sales started to rise in the early 90's and for the most part, didn’t slow down(except for 2001/2002) until 2011. 2009/2010 were by far the golden era for video game. Not just for the companies behind the platform, or the studio's responsible for the product, but also for the consumer. During 2009, blockbuster games like Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, littlebigplanet(psp),and assassins creed 2 were all very good games, and were marketed extremely well leading up to the 2009 release season.
