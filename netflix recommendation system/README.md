This is a case study.

Different people have different taste in movies, and this is not reflected in a single score that we see when we google a movie. We use machine learning to build a personalized movie recommendation system based on userâ€™s previous movie ratings. Our movie scoring system helps users instantly discover movies to their liking, regardless of how distinct their tastes may be.
